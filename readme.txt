Georgia Tech Room Reservation Service

What is this project:
- This project is coded in Python 3
- It is a Mock Room Reservation service for Georgia Tech
- SQL was implemented to pull data from the school provided database
- GUIs were coded as the interface for the project

How to run this;
- This project can be run in IDLE
- HOWEVER - this project can no longer access the database because it was taken down after the completion of the project
- But the code is a good example for coding GUIs and implementing SQL with Python
